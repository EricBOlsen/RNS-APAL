//		Original Release:	V0.10:	June 5, 2016, Eric B. Olsen 
//	
//							V0.101:	June 6, Added license text
//							V0.103: June 8, 2016, Fixed SPMF::Prints() method and fixed Sqrt() method to pass back error code
//							V0.105: October 22, 2017, Added full MOD to PPMDigit::Sub function, helps stabilize library for software testing
//													re-organized config.h and config.cpp for easier user adjustment of configuration with much less crashes,
//													added PPM::Div6 and PPM::Div7 as experiemental divide routines that exhibit less cycles,
//													added extended Euclidean routine as default option for inverse multiplication,  
//													continues to support LUT methods for inverse multiplication as user settable option
//							V0.106:	October 25, 2017, Added a define to set the default console width.  Located in "config.h", good for Win10 console which is wider, and much better.
//							V0.107: December 31, 2019, Modified print demo routine for future expansion.
